## Book List

### Interview Prep

- [ ] [Programming Interviews Exposed: Coding Your Way Through the Interview, 4th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Through-Interview/dp/111941847X/)
    - answers in C++ and Java
    - this is a good warm-up for Cracking the Coding Interview
    - not too difficult, most problems may be easier than what you'll see in an interview (from what I've read)
### C++

I haven't read these two, but they are highly rated and written by Sedgewick. He's awesome.

- [ ] [Algorithms in C++, Parts 1-4: Fundamentals, Data Structure, Sorting, Searching](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Parts-1-4-Fundamentals-Structure/dp/0201350882/)
- [ ] [Algorithms in C++ Part 5: Graph Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Part-Graph-3rd-Pt-5/dp/0201361183/)
- [ ] [Open Data Structures in C++](https://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp.pdf)
    - Rich and detailed collection of Data Structures and Algorithms
    - Great for first-timers

If you have a better recommendation for C++, please let me know. Looking for a comprehensive resource.
