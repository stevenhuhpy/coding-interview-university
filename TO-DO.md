- Resume first. 
  - Select companys you prefer to go and then select one or two positions for each company. Write the resume according to the requirements.
  - Create sub folders for each company-resume. 
  - Add or Link knowledge to each resume where you mentioned them.


- Select item that you think(maybe according to the resume contents) requires to learn and Mark it.

- Create a sub folder named by the item before you learn it so you could record everything related into the folder.

- Each sub folder should create a readme file(flash card) to guide the review in the future. Remember to record the each date-time when you learn or review the topic so you know if you consolidate your knowledge.
