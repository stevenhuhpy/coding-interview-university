## Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis

- Nothing to implement
- There are a lot of videos here. Just watch enough until you understand it. You can always come back and review
- If some lectures are too mathy, you can jump down to the bottom and watch the discrete mathematics videos to get the background knowledge
